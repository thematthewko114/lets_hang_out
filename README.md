# Let's Hang Out!
 
Getting your friend group to schedule a gathering can be a pain in the ass. Imagine everyone just put their available timeslots in a chat (WhatsApp or Signal), wouldn't it be nicer if you can visualize in a calendar? This website provides that for you! The website is available [here](https://lets-hang-out.vercel.app/). It is being actively developed, feel free to contribute!

# How to use

You can create a "room" for gathering timeslots of your friends. You can set your timeslots and restrictions, then share the link to your friends for them to set timeslots. You can then see which day(s) you can meet up. It's much less of a hassle than before! You don't even need to login, the room is accessible all people with links, so make sure you send the link to the right people!

# For development

I developed this website the NodeJS v18.18.2, Go v1.18.1 with Linux, so it is advised fror you to do that.
