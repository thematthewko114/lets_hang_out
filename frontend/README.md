# Frontend

Requirement: have NodeJS installed in your OS (preferably v18.18.2)

This project uses the SolidJS framework alongside Tailwind CSS and Flowbite for UI components. 

SolidJS is chosen as an alternative to React because it is more efficient with reactive primitives as to avoid overloading the browser, and the entire project can be very lightweight (deployment can be done in 15 seconds). Tailwind and Flowbite provide quick solutions to designed components so I can focus on functionalities than raging at CSS.

To run the code, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The client should be running in [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The frontend uses Vite as a build tool as an alternative to NPM.
