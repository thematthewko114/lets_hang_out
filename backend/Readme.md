Requirement: have Go installed in your OS (preferably v1.18.1)

I want to use Go for some projects, and they have a web framework in Gin, so I just gave it a go (see what I did here?).

run the following command:

```
go get .
cd src
go run main.go
```

The server should be running in [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), but there is not root API written, you can use [this](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/) to have a test response.
